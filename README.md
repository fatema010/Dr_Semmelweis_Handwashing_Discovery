## Project Details

- **Motivation:** The project aims to explore and verify Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis' discovery that handwashing significantly reduces the mortality rates of
    pregnant women in maternity clinics.

- **Notebook:** The main analysis is documented in the Jupyter Notebook titled "practice.ipynb". This notebook contains data preprocessing,
 visualization, statistical analysis, and conclusions drawn from the data.

- **Language:** Python

## Dataset

- **Source:** The dataset used for analysis is historical medical data from maternity clinics in the mid-19th century,
before and after the implementation of handwashing practices.

## Analysis

- **Data Cleaning:** The dataset underwent data cleaning, handling missing values and inconsistencies to ensure accurate analysis.

- **Visualization:** Visualizations were created to compare mortality rates before and after handwashing implementation,
  illustrating the impact on maternal deaths.

- **Statistical Analysis:** Statistical tests were performed to validate the significance of the reduction in mortality rates due to handwashing.

## Key Insights

- The analysis confirmed Dr. Semmelweis' hypothesis that proper handwashing significantly reduced maternal mortality rates.
  
- The project highlights the importance of data-driven decision-making in healthcare practices.
